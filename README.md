# COVID_19-_dashboard
Created a dashboard along with a few visualizations for COVID-19 using tableau.

The dataset is taken from GitHub.com (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

As a part of this project, I have used data from a github repository and performed ETL operations in Pentaho and stored the data in SQL database. Using Tableau visualization techniques, I have created meaningful insights. Following are the steps completed as a part of this COVID-19 project:
● Powershell : Pull data from Git(Upto 25th April)
● Store the data in local device
● Separate out the data based on different data formats
● Using Pentaho - created transformations to combine the data and store in SQL database
● Created tables using SQL to get the count of Cases/deaths/Recovered cases per day
● Visualization based on cleaned data
